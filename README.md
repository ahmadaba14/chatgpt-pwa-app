A PWA App for ChatGPT
# ChatGPT Multi-Tab PWA

A Progressive Web App (PWA) that keeps multiple ChatGPT sessions handy. The app
wraps the web version of ChatGPT in a streamlined shell with custom tab
management. It can run directly in the browser, be installed as a PWA, or be
bundled into a desktop installer (Windows `.exe`, macOS `.dmg/.zip`, Linux
`.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm`) via Electron Builder.

## Features

- **Multiple Chat Tabs** – open as many ChatGPT sessions as you need and switch
  between them instantly.
- **Lightweight PWA** – installable on desktop and mobile with offline caching
  handled by an auto-updating service worker.
- **Desktop Packaging** – Electron wrapper and Builder configuration to create
  native installers, including a Windows setup `.exe`.
- **Fallback Controls** – quick access buttons to reload a session or open it in
  your system browser when ChatGPT requires re-authentication.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`. During development you can launch the
Electron shell alongside Vite with:

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The optimized PWA bundle is generated inside the `dist/` folder.

## Creating installers

1. Build the PWA so the Electron app can load the static assets:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Package installers with Electron Builder:

   ```bash
   npm run electron:package
   ```

   The output appears under the `dist/` folder generated by Electron Builder
   (e.g. `dist/ChatGPT Multi-Tab PWA Setup.exe`).

> **Note:** Building native installers requires the respective platform tooling
> (for example, Windows packaging must run on Windows). The Builder
> configuration included here is ready for those environments.

## PWA installation tips

- On desktop browsers, use the install icon in the address bar to add the app to
  your operating system.
- On mobile, use “Add to Home Screen” once the site has loaded.

## Publishing the project to GitHub

If you started from the zip/tarball provided with this project you can push it to
your own GitHub repository with the following steps:

1. [Create a blank repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) (do not add a
   README, `.gitignore`, or license during creation).
2. Add your GitHub repo as the `origin` remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
   ```

   If you prefer HTTPS, swap the URL for
   `https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git`.
3. Push the existing history to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin work
   ```

   Replace `work` with whatever branch name you are using (the default in this
   template is `work`).
4. Open the repository page on GitHub and verify that the files and commit
   history appear as expected.
