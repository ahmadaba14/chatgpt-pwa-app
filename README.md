-# chatgpt-pwa-app
-A PWA App for ChatGPT
+# ChatGPT Multi-Tab PWA
+
+A Progressive Web App (PWA) that keeps multiple ChatGPT sessions handy. The app
+wraps the web version of ChatGPT in a streamlined shell with custom tab
+management. It can run directly in the browser, be installed as a PWA, or be
+bundled into a desktop installer (Windows `.exe`, macOS `.dmg/.zip`, Linux
+`.AppImage`/`.deb`/`.rpm`) via Electron Builder.
+
+## Features
+
+- **Multiple Chat Tabs** – open as many ChatGPT sessions as you need and switch
+  between them instantly.
+- **Lightweight PWA** – installable on desktop and mobile with offline caching
+  handled by an auto-updating service worker.
+- **Desktop Packaging** – Electron wrapper and Builder configuration to create
+  native installers, including a Windows setup `.exe`.
+- **Fallback Controls** – quick access buttons to reload a session or open it in
+  your system browser when ChatGPT requires re-authentication.
+
+## Getting started
+
+```bash
+npm install
+npm run dev
+```
+
+The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`. During development you can launch the
+Electron shell alongside Vite with:
+
+```bash
+npm run electron:dev
+```
+
+## Production build
+
+```bash
+npm run build
+npm run preview
+```
+
+The optimized PWA bundle is generated inside the `dist/` folder.
+
+## Creating installers
+
+1. Build the PWA so the Electron app can load the static assets:
+
+   ```bash
+   npm run build
+   ```
+
+2. Package installers with Electron Builder:
+
+   ```bash
+   npm run electron:package
+   ```
+
+   The output appears under the `dist/` folder generated by Electron Builder
+   (e.g. `dist/ChatGPT Multi-Tab PWA Setup.exe`).
+
+> **Note:** Building native installers requires the respective platform tooling
+> (for example, Windows packaging must run on Windows). The Builder
+> configuration included here is ready for those environments.
+
+## PWA installation tips
+
+- On desktop browsers, use the install icon in the address bar to add the app to
+  your operating system.
+- On mobile, use “Add to Home Screen” once the site has loaded.
